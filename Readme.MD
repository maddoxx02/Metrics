# The QUAD Metrics for Process Modelling

This Repository houses the QUAD metrics adapted for process modelling toolkit ProFIT.

The Metrics are: 

  1. **Replay Fitness**
  2. **Precision**
  3. **Generalization**
  4. **Simplicity**

By evaluating a Process model with these metrics, we can  obtain a balanced perspective on the Complexity & Understandability of the model.

These Metrics are ready to use & are configured to run in Regime 1 & Regime 2 (Provided in the documentation).

On simulating these Metrics, a combined numeric graph can be generated as follows:

Currently, these metrics are in the .IPYNB format, they are being ported into Library-style files & will be uploaded in this repository (~August 2023)
